# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project implements **K-Means Clustering** to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history for **unsupervised customer segmentation**.

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

- Applies **K-Means Clustering** on synthetic or real customer purchase data (e.g., annual income, spending score).
- Visualizes customer segments to help in **targeted marketing and personalized strategies**.
- Can be extended to real-world retail datasets for deeper business insights.

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Data loading and preprocessing (scaling and cleaning).  
✅ K-Means clustering with configurable `n_clusters`.  
✅ Elbow method plot to determine optimal clusters.  
✅ 2D/3D cluster visualization for interpretability.  
✅ Clean, modular code suitable for ML learning projects.
